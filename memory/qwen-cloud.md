# Qwen Cloud Memory

## Hackathon Requirement

Qwen Cloud must be central to the Track 1 submission. It should power memory reasoning, not appear as a side integration.

## Required Qwen-Driven Functions

- Extract durable memories from conversations, run summaries, and tool logs.
- Classify memory type, scope, importance, and validity.
- Detect conflicts between new and existing memories.
- Build token-budgeted context packs.
- Reflect on completed agent runs.
- Explain why memories were used or ignored.

## Long-Term Constraint

The product is Qwen-first for the hackathon but provider-agnostic long term. Qwen must sit behind `QwenMemoryProvider`, not inside the memory core.

## Alibaba Cloud Deployment

Hackathon backend should run on Alibaba Cloud and include visible code-level proof of Alibaba Cloud service/API usage. Storage can be Postgres/pgvector as long as deployment proof is clear.
